        <p>
          I got fascinated by programming, because it can bring my ideas to life
          with code, and I can make something for people all over the world can
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a bachelor in English Literature 📚 & Trade 🗺, worked in
          logistics field for 3.5 years. While I was working fulltime, I taught
          myself Python and made a bot to automate repetitive manual work. That
          experience led me to explore more about the programming world and
          that’s when I started having a dream of myself coding even when I was
          sleeping. This year, I quit my job so as not to leave that dream as a
          dream.
